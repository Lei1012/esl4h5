		This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from www.eslpassport.com (the “Site”). You accept this Privacy Policy when you access or make use of our services, content, features, or functions offered on www.eslpassport.com (collectively “ESL Passport Services”). 
		We collect the following types of personal information in order to provide you with the use of ESL Passport Services and to help us personalize and improve your experience. When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.
		Information from devices: When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.” 
		We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
		We collect Device Information using the following technologies
		    - “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
		    - “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
		    - “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.
		Using Your Mobile Device: We may offer you the ability to connect with ESL Passport Services using a mobile device, either through a mobile application or via a mobile-optimized website. The provisions of this Privacy Policy apply to all such mobile access and use of mobile devices.
		When you download or use our mobile applications or access one of our mobile optimized sites, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to control or disable location services in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to disable your device's location services, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or the manufacture of your particular device.
		The information you provide to us: We may collect and store any information you provide us when you use ESL Passport Services, including when you add or update your account information, leave reviews, participate in community discussions, or when you otherwise correspond with us regarding ESL Passport Services.
		We may also collect information from or about you from other sources, such as through your contact with us, including our customer support team, your results when you respond to a survey, your interactions with members of the ESL Passport corporate family or other companies (subject to their privacy policies and applicable law), and from other accounts we have reason to believe you control (whether in part or in whole). Additionally, for quality and training purposes or for its own protection, ESL Passport may monitor or record its telephone conversations with you or anyone acting on your behalf. By communicating with ESL Passport, you acknowledge that your communication may be overheard, monitored, or recorded without further notice or warning.
		Information from other sources: We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as various job boards, industry blogs, blacklists, certifying bodies, institutions, integrated social media channels and software programs.
		To build our reports and databases to support a global transparent hub, we collect large imports of industry data from other public sources with the sole purpose of formulating industry trends and patterns for our annual global reports and database of business names. This includes but is not limited to business names, job posts, job details, job post contact information, a record of the source of job posts, job vacancy locations, and job posts titles.
		You may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties such as social media sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). The information we may receive varies by site and is controlled by that site. By associating an account managed by a third party with your ESL Passport account and authorizing ESL Passport to have access to this information, you agree that ESL Passport may collect, store, and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
		Due to our global nature, ESL Passport only uses the services provided by PayPal. We do not have access to or record any of our clients' private financial information. Please review and agree to PayPal's privacy policy before making any purchases with ESL Passport.
		Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We may use your personal information to:
		provide ESL Passport Services and customer support;
		verify your identity, including during account creation and password reset processes;
		poll your opinions through surveys or questionnaires;
		offer coupons, discounts, and promotions;
		resolve disputes, and troubleshoot problems;

		Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful requests for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.
		Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the term "Personal Information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user.
		THIRD PARTIES

(Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information.

If you post information, we have no control over this use of your information and, as such, cannot be responsible for it.
